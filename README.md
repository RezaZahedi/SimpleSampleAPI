# Details
This app uses a map as a database for simplicity. You can test the app with following commands:
```
    // to get all of the books
	curl localhost:8080/books
    
    // to get a specific book
	curl localhost:8080/book/2

    // to create a new book instance
	curl -X POST -d '{"Id":5, "Name":"Reza"}' -L localhost:8080/book/5
	
    // to delete a specific book instance
        curl -X DELETE -L localhost:8080/book/5
    
    // to search for a specific book name
	curl localhost:8080/book?name="Elevation"

```
